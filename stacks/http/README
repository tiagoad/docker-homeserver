I have not included my authelia.yml and traefik-providers.toml as they reveal a bit more about my infrastructure than I would like. I have included example files.

Also, /data/auth.yml needs to be created on the host persistence directory.

I use something like this:

---

users:
  admin:
    password: "<HASH>"
    email: admin@example.com
    groups:
      - admin

  friend:
    password: "<HASH>"
    email: friend@example.com
